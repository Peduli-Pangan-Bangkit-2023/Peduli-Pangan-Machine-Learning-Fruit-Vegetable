### Predicting Fruit Ripeness for Determining Expiry Time

## Introduction 
This repository contains a predictive model designed to determine the ripeness of fruits and vegetables, aiding in the estimation of their expiration time. The model uses machine learning techniques to predict the maturity of produce based on various features.

## Background
Indonesia's reliance on food imports undermines its food security and autonomy, leaving the population vulnerable to foreign influence. Persistent food waste exacerbates the issue, causing hunger among many citizens. To combat these challenges, we aim to foster food sovereignty in Indonesia through the development of the Peduli Pangan application. This initiative seeks to empower individuals, promote equitable consumption practices, and uphold social justice within the food sector.

## Problem Statement 
Despite Indonesia's abundant natural resources, achieving food sovereignty poses significant challenges. The dependence on food imports and prevalent food wastage perpetuates hunger and susceptibility to external influences. The lack of equitable distribution compounds these issues, resulting in social injustices within the food industry.

## Goal
1. Develop Peduli Pangan Application: Create a user-friendly application to educate and empower individuals in making informed consumption choices, fostering self-reliance.
2. Contribute to Food Sovereignty: Through the application, aim to reduce dependency on imports, minimize food waste, and empower local communities to achieve greater food sovereignty.

## Project Focus
The project centers on developing a ripeness prediction system to determine the expiration time of fruits and vegetables. This system serves as part of the solution to reduce food wastage, enhance distribution efficiency, and support food self-reliance in striving towards greater food sovereignty.

## Dataset 

The dataset used for training and testing the model originates from the [FRINN repository](https://github.com/ece324-2020/FRINN). The goal of FRINN is to develop a model (NN) to classify both the state and type of an input fruit image. 

### FRINN Dataset Details:
- **Fruit Types:** Apples, Oranges, Bananas, Raspberries, Strawberries
- **Fruit States:** Ripe, Unripe, Rotten

The dataset encompasses images of these fruits categorized by their type and state.
