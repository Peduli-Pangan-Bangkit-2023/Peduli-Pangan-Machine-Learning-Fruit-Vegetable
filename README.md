### Predicting Produce Ripeness for Determining Expiry Time

## Introduction 
This repository contains a predictive model designed to determine the ripeness of fruits and vegetables, aiding in the estimation of their expiration time. The model uses machine learning techniques to predict the maturity of produce based on various features.

## Dataset 
The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in this repository. You can find the datasets in the `/buah sayur` directory. Below are brief descriptions of each dataset:

#### Dataset Name 1
- **Description:** [Add a brief description of Dataset 1, such as the types of fruits or vegetables included, the number of samples, and any relevant attributes.]

#### Dataset Name 2
- **Description:** [Include a brief description of Dataset 2, providing details on the nature of the data, its size, and any specific features.]

Feel free to explore the datasets within the `/buah sayur` directory for a comprehensive understanding of the training and testing data utilized in the model.
